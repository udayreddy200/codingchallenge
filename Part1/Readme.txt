1)What is your design and implementation?
I have created simple static queue to share the data across.
I have cteated random number using Randomizer method
then I have passed queue to primeRandomizer to find is it a prime. 
2)Sample Output
This is the random value generated: 10
This is the Random Integer:10 and it is prime:false
3)Further work – if you have all the time in the world how would you implement

I can implement using RMI/Threads/JMS
